# multispecies_occpuancy_model

### To simulate some occupancy data and fit a single species occupancy model
- navigate to the "./single_species_occupancy_model" folder.
- open the file "simple_occupancy_model.R". This file will walk you through simulating some occupancy patterns and then some imperfect detection of the data through some simulated field surveys.
- After the data is simulated, the file will prompt you to fit a stan model, the file named "simple_occupancy_model.stan". If you haven't cloned into my Github repository directly, you can still run the model by placing it in the same folder as the .R file and making sure you've set this folder as your working directory.
- The occupancy model will estimate occurrence rate and detection rate for the single species that was used in the data simulation. Feel free to adjust the simulation settings, including the occurrence and detection rates, number of sites, or adding covariates.
- Future additions here will help you to build on this basic occupancy model template!
